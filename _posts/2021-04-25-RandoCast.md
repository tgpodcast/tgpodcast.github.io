**Literally just Bubby and Chephadrom talking about TG Earth for half an hour**

OGBUBBY and titaniumcow interview three "randos": Datbrrto, Chephadrom, and Spaciergiant. Really the only discussion that happened was Bubby talking about TGN and Chephadrom talking about Earth, but you might as well listen anyways, because let's be honest, you don't have anything better to do. (Also sorry in advance for the constant pvp noises in the background)
